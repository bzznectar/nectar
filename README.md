## Overview
Nectar is a Layer 2 solution running on the Swarm Network. The Swarm Network and the DAPP ecosystem form the first layer of its infrastructure,  while the BzzHive token economy is built on top of it.  
It creates a more elaborate reward system for node operators that works as an addition to Swarm’s native incentives system. To become part of the BzzHive economy you need to download and install the Nectar client. Currently, our client is only available for Linux distributions.  
It has the following features:  
●	Cashout and withdraw rewards to/from local nodes.  
●	Redeem and deposit  
●	Search information (chequebook address, address balance, chequebook balance...)    
Below you’ll find resources for:  
●	Where to find the latest version of Nectar.  
●	How to install  Nectar on Linux   
●	How to run the project using Docker  
●	How to configure your APIs to get the most out of the available features  
NOTE: You need to have a full Swarm node installed and configured before using Nectar.
